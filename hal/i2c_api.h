/**
 * \defgroup hal_i2c I2C hal
 *
 * The I2C hal provides a low level interface to the I2C interface of a target.
 *
 * # Defined behaviour
 * * The function ::i2c_init initialises the peripheral pins specified in the input parameters,
 * initialises the peripheral in master mode if `is_slave` is false,
 * initialises the peripheral in slave mode if `is_slave` is true and `supports_slave_mode` is true  - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_init_free.
 * * The function ::i2c_free resets the pins used to initialise the peripheral to their default state,
 * disables the peripheral clock - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_init_free.
 * * The function ::i2c_get_capabilities fills the contents of the `i2c_capabilities_t` parameter - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_get_capabilities.
 * * The function ::i2c_frequency sets the frequency to use for the transfer, returns the actual frequency that will be used,
 * must leave all other configuration unchanged - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_frequency.
 * * The function ::i2c_timeout sets the transmision timeout to use for the following blocking transfers,
 * if the timeout is not set the default timeout is used,
 * default timeout value is based on I2C frequency. Is computed as triple amount of time it would take to send data over I2C - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_blocking_transmission_timeout.
 * * The function ::i2c_write writes `length` number of symbols to the bus, returns the number of symbols sent to the bus,
 * returns an error code if transfer fails, generates a stop condition on the bus at the end of the transfer if `stop` parameter is true,
 * handles transfer collisions and loss of arbitration if the platform supports multimaster in hardware,
 * the transfer will timeout and return `I2C_ERROR_TIMEOUT ` if the transfer takes longer than the configured timeout duration - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_blocking_write_read.
 * * The function ::i2c_read reads `length` symbols from the bus, returns the number of symbols received from the bus,
 * returns an error code if transfer fails, generates a stop condition on the bus at the end of the transfer if `stop` parameter is true,
 * handles transfer collisions and loss of arbitration if the platform supports multimaster in hardware,
 * the transfer will timeout and return `I2C_ERROR_TIMEOUT ` if the transfer takes longer than the configured timeout duration - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_blocking_write_read.
 * * The function ::i2c_start generates I2C START condition on the bus in master mode, does nothing if called when the peripheral is configured in slave mode - not tested.
 * * The function ::i2c_stop generates I2C STOP condition on the bus in master mode, does nothing if called when the peripheral is configured in slave mode
 * - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_blocking_write_read ::fpga_i2c_test_async_write_read.
 * * The function ::i2c_slave_status indicates which mode the peripheral has been addressed in, Returns not addressed when called in master mode - not tested.
 * * The function ::i2c_slave_address sets the address of the peripheral to the `address` parameter, does nothing if called in master mode - not tested.
 * * The function ::i2c_transfer_async returns immediately with a `bool` indicating whether the transfer was successfully scheduled or not,
 * the callback given to `i2c_transfer_async` is invoked when the transfer finishes or error occurs,
 * must save the handler and context pointers inside the `obj` pointer, the context pointer is passed to the callback on transfer completion,
 * the callback must be invoked on completion unless the transfer is aborted, the callback must be invoked on completion unless the transfer is aborted,
 * may handle transfer collisions and loss of arbitration if the platform supports multimaster in hardware and enabled in API,
 * `i2c_async_event_t` must be filled with the number of symbols sent to the bus during transfer - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_async_write_read.
 * * The function ::i2c_abort_async Aborts any on-going async transfers - Verified by test ::fpga_i2c_test_async_abort.
 *
 * # Undefined behaviours
 *
 * * Use of a `null` pointer as an argument to any function.
 * * Calling any `I2C` function before calling ::i2c_init or after calling ::i2c_free.
 * * Initialising the `I2C` peripheral with invalid `SDA` and `SCL` pins.
 * * Initialising the peripheral in slave mode if slave mode is not supported, indicated by ::i2c_get_capabilities.
 * * Operating the peripheral in slave mode without first specifying and address using ::i2c_slave_address.
 * * Setting an address using i2c_slave_address after initialising the peripheral in master mode.
 * * Setting an address to an `I2C` reserved value.
 * * Setting an address larger than the 7-bit supported maximum if 10-bit addressing is not supported.
 * * Setting an address larger than the 10-bit supported maximum.
 * * Setting a frequency outside the supported range given by ::i2c_get_capabilities.
 * * Using the device in a multimaster configuration when `supports_multimaster_mode` is false.
 * * Specifying an invalid address when calling any `read` or `write` functions.
 * * Setting the length of the transfer or receive buffers to larger than the buffers are.
 * * Passing an invalid pointer as `handler` to ::i2c_transfer_async.
 * * Calling ::i2c_abort_async when no transfer is currently in progress.
